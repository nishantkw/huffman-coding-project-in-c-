# huffman-coding-project-in-c-
A C++ project implementing Huffman coding aims to demonstrate a lossless data compression algorithm. The core functionality involves compressing a given input (e.g., a text file) and then decompressing it back to its original form.

Project Components:

Frequency Analysis:

Read the input data and calculate the frequency of occurrence for each unique character. This information is crucial for building the Huffman tree.

Huffman Tree Construction:

Utilize a min-priority queue (often implemented with a min-heap) to manage nodes based on their frequencies.
Repeatedly extract the two nodes with the lowest frequencies, combine them into a new parent node with their summed frequency, and insert the new node back into the priority queue. 
This process continues until only one node remains, which becomes the root of the Huffman tree.

Code Generation:

Traverse the constructed Huffman tree (e.g., using a recursive depth-first traversal).
Assign binary codes to each character by assigning '0' for a left branch and '1' for a right branch during traversal. The path from the root to a leaf node represents the character's unique Huffman code.

Encoding (Compression):

Read the input data again.
For each character, replace it with its corresponding Huffman code.
Write the concatenated binary codes to an output file. This compressed file should ideally be smaller than the original.
Store the Huffman tree or the frequency table (which allows reconstruction of the tree during decompression) within the compressed file or in a separate header.

Decoding (Decompression):

Read the compressed data, including the stored Huffman tree/frequency table.
Reconstruct the Huffman tree if only the frequency table was stored.
Read the compressed binary stream bit by bit.
Traverse the Huffman tree based on the incoming bits (left for '0', right for '1').
When a leaf node is reached, the corresponding character is found and written to the output file.
Repeat until the entire compressed stream is decoded.

Key C++ Concepts Used:

Classes and Objects: To represent Huffman tree nodes, potentially a HuffmanTree class, and a HuffmanEncoder/Decoder class.
Data Structures: std::map for frequency counting, std::priority_queue (or custom min-heap) for tree construction, std::string or std::vector<bool> for storing binary codes.
File I/O: fstream for reading and writing to files.
Pointers: For linking nodes in the Huffman tree.
Recursion: Often used for tree traversal and code generation.
